--ABOUT 
This is my first Ludum Dare or gamejam in general, I don't know what I was waiting so long for, this is too much fun. I made the game using Unity 5 and Blender. The music was generated using autotracker.py (you can find it under tools on this page), since my music making skills are nonexistent. For now it runs on Windows, Web with Unity plugin, planning on setting it up for Android soon too.
